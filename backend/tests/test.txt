Image Classification: This involves training a model to identify and categorize images into predefined classes. A practical implementation could use datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet to teach the model to distinguish between objects such as cars, animals, or furniture. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often used for this task due to their ability to detect spatial hierarchies in images. Tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch make it easy to implement and fine-tune models. You could also experiment with transfer learning by using pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG and adapting them to your specific dataset.

Sentiment Analysis: This task involves using machine learning to determine the emotional tone of text, such as reviews or tweets. You can start with labeled datasets like IMDb reviews or Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset. Techniques can range from simple bag-of-words and logistic regression to advanced methods like BERT or LSTMs. Itâ€™s widely applicable in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and even political campaign management. Implementation is straightforward with libraries like Hugging Face Transformers or NLTK for preprocessing text.
