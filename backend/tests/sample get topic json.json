        "Main Idea": "CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)",
        "Summary": "CNNs are a type of deep learning model primarily used for analyzing visual data. They employ convolutional layers to apply filters on input data for capturing spatial features such as edges, textures, and patterns. Pooling layers help in reducing dimensionality, which enhances computational efficiency while retaining crucial information. CNNs are prominently used in image recognition, object detection, and video processing. Renowned CNN architectures like AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG have revolutionized computer vision, delivering state-of-the-art performance across various domains.",
